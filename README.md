In light of technological advancements and the digitization of information, the upsurge in network data traffic has ushered in both opportunities and challenges. This digital transformation has brought about an increase in network attacks, which pose significant threats to computer systems and sensitive data. As the utilization of the internet rises, the vulnerabilities in network security appear to escalate proportionally. In response, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as a formidable approach to identify unauthorized access and attacks within a network, providing a shield against potential intruders.
These intrusion detection systems have seamlessly integrated into modern communication networks, assuming a pivotal role in preserving the integrity of private data against unauthorized access. Within the dynamic landscape of business environments, robust security measures are imperative to thwart the actions of unauthorized individuals. The existing intrusion detection systems represent an evolutionary leap beyond traditional antivirus software. They can be primarily categorized into two operational types:

In recognition of the rising threat panorama, the development of effective IDS has become a necessity. The implementation process typically unfolds in four sequential stages:

**Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The initial phase entails the collection of data, followed by meticulous preprocessing to ensure data quality while eliminating redundancy.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This phase involves a deep dive into the dataset, uncovering insights, patterns, and statistical attributes. EDA aids in comprehending the dataset's structure and identifying potential features for analysis.

**Classifier Training and Testing:** At the core of the IDS lies the training and testing of classifiers. Three primary classifiers—Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbours—are employed to assess the dataset and make predictions.
